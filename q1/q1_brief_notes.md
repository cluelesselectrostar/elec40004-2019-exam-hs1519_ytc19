Notes for Q1
============

- null pointers do not appear on the dot graph.

T1 - Statistics
---------------
- T1.1 Tree Height - trivial.
- T1.2 Tree Balance - calculates balance. relatively trivial.
- T1.3 Test Inputs - use balance stattstic to reverse engineer tree structure. - time consuming, but relatively easy.

T2 - Visualise with dot
-----------------------
- T2.1 Render tree out as dot. in `render_as_dot.cpp` - medium.
- T2.2 Create visualisation scripts - easy, be careful with output types.

T3 - Balancing 
--------------
- T3.1 Collect nodes in order (vector pointing to all nodes in tree) - medium
- T3.2 Rebuild tree balanced - should be easy after the vector has been worked out in part 3.1.

T4 - Sets
---------
- T4.1 Change UnbalancedStringSet from struct to class - easy?
- T4.2 EqualBalance Stringset - should probably base class on unbalancedstringset. 
- T4.3 Update factory function with equalbalancestringset - easy. should be independent as well.
