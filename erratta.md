### Q3/T3.1 - Table in impedance section is wrong
  For the last row (C1&C2), the impedances should be -3j, -1.5j and -0.75j respectively.

### Q3/T1.4 - Examples of ordering primitives is wrong
  R1 < L0.3 is wrong as L < R earlier. 

### Q3/Description of Tree nodes
The underlying data primitive used in this question is tree_node, which is defined in `tree.hpp`

### Q1/Measuring Tree balance
For h=5, b should be 0.167; for h=3, b should be -0.167 (negative as expected, since you can't really achieve 
tree height less than optimal height 4)
